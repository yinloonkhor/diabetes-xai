# XAI Alternative Assessment

This project demonstrates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques for diabetes prediction using machine learning. Using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, it focuses on building interpretable models to predict diabetes outcomes and explaining the predictions through various XAI methods.

## Project Structure

- **app.py** - Interactive Streamlit web application for model exploration and XAI visualization
- **code.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook with detailed demonstrations and analysis
- **archive/diabetes.csv** - Pima Indians Diabetes Database used for training and evaluation
- **requirements.txt** - Python dependencies

## Files

### app.py
A Streamlit application that provides an interactive interface for:
- Diabetes risk predictions
- Feature importance visualization
- Explainable AI insights
- Interactive data exploration

To run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### code.ipynb
A comprehensive Jupyter notebook containing:
- Pima Indians Diabetes Database exploration and preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation for diabetes prediction
- XAI technique demonstrations
- Visualizations and analysis

## Installation

Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Interactive App**: Run `streamlit run app.py` to launch the web interface
2. **Notebook Demo**: Open `code.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab or VS Code to explore the full analysis

## Requirements

See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for a complete list of dependencies.
